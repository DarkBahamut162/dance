# InTheGroove Dance Noteskins
Another something I indirectly took over...

I yoinked them from [Project OutFox's Noteskins Content Section](https://projectoutfox.com/addons/noteskins) and upgraded them.

# What I did
- Code **Refactoring**
- Made sure certain Noteskins are actually **double-sided**
- Added **Fakes** & **Lifts**

# What I didn't do (yet?)
- Not all Noteskins are truly double-sided
  - Mines aren't double-sided at all
- Not all Noteskins have Fakes/Lifts
- None of them have Center Tap Notes
